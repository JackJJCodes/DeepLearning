3. <a href="https://github.com/JackJJCodes/DeepLearning/blob/main/FromScratch/HiddenLayersAndNeurons.ipynb">HiddenLayersAndNeurons.ipynb</a>: Simple demonstration of using KerasClassifer to find out optimum number of hidden layers and neurons required for deep learning.

## DataAugmentation:
Data augmentation is the process of altering an image, for the purpose of creating more images. If we have an image of a cat, then we would resize it, invert it, swap it etc to create more images for our dataset.
This helps in increasing robustness of our deep learning model.
